Black Thursday DTR Memo:
Christine Gamble, Lucy Fox

1. We both would like to improve our TDD. We would really like to focus on writing tests first.

2. We both prefer afternoons/after school. Morning sucks! Christine cannot work much on Saturday.
For now, the plan will be to split up work, but expect most of it is done by Sunday.
We will also have Friday night be a no code night. If we need to we can come into Turing Sunday for pairing.

3. Slack and in person. We will try to use Waffle to keep up on where the other is on their workload.
We will use slack to communicate outside of turing. We will let each other know when we finish a task.

4. Christine would like to improve TDD, she feels strong in debugging techniques. To assist with improving
TDD skills we will try to write all our test first and improve test coverage. Lucy feels strong about
debugging techniques and would like to work on refactoring. We will try to refactor as we go and improve these skills.

5. We don't have any preferences regarding which pieces we work on. We just would like to improve
the above stated areas as we work.

6. We will do all our work on branches and review branches before merging to master.
Person A will work on a branch. When they are done with that branch and ready to merge they will
indicate that using waffle. Then they will create a pull request. Person B will review the request
and merge to master. We will notify each other when we are ready to create pull requests via slack.

7. When we run into any issues implementing a feature we will make sure to communicate with each other
and help each other figure out the problem.

8. We are both happy with open communication and feedback as we go.

9. We are comfortable with remote pairing if we cannot both be at Turing during the day. We plan to talk a lot as we go!

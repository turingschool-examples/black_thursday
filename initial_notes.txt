Iteration Zero:
- goal : "Data Access Layer" (DAL) for multiple CSV files; make accessible data that can be queried (items and merchants)
- classes involved in DAL:
1 SalesEngine: ties everything together
  - items
  - merchants
2 MerchantRepository: holds and searches for Merchant instances
3 Merchant: important in data hierarchy
  -merchant id and name
4 ItemRepository: holds and searches for Item instances
  -one ITEM object reps one line of data from the items.csv
5 Item

Iteration One:
- goal: build relationships between objects and derive some BI
1 Relationships Layer
  -Item#merchant_id = Merchant#id (common find_by_id method)
2 Analysis Layer
  - calculate information
  -classes:
  a - SalesAnalyst (sa) - answer questions (1) average_items_per_merchant (2) average_items_per_merchant_standard_deviation (3) merchants_with_high_item_count (4) average_item_price_per_merchant(merchant_id) (5) average_average_price_per_merchant (6)golden_items = anything that is two standard deviations away from the average item price

Iteration Two:
- goal: tie in all the DAL, relationships and BI
- DAL classes:
  -Invoice
  -InvoiceRepository: holds and searches for Invoice instances
- Relationship classes:
  -use SalesEngine to connect invoices to merchants

DESIGN layers per class beginning two?
foundation: DAL
Relationship Layer
Analysis Layer

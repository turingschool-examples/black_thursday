263400329,Green-turned Eucalyptus Bowl,"Eucalyptus wood hand turned & finished bowl.  This is a beautiful piece of wood turned very fresh.  Eucalyptus is renowned for being very wet and for moving a lot as it dries.  This started out as a perfectly round bowl but has warped and moved to find it&#39;s own shape.  It&#39;s very tactile and has settled into a lovely organic shape.  **It&#39;s fairly dry now but may move more, especially if your home is warmer or drier than mine. This may include cracking and splitting as well as warping and moving.  This is a natural process.  The wood came from a tree surgeon friend who removed an overgrown tree for a customer.

It&#39;s finished with walnut oil.

155mm x 135mm &#39;diameter&#39; x 70mm high

All of the wood I use for my bowls comes from trees grown in the UK from sustainable sources.  The majority of it comes from my own garden – either trimmings or from trees removed as part of regular management.  Other wood comes from friends and neighbours who have had trees trimmed or removed.  A few bowls are made from wood bought from a supplier of bowl blanks – this is not a source I use any more, not for any environmental or other concerns, simply because I have a very good stock of more local wood now.  For the future I intend that all of the wood I use will be local and that the source and reason for felling will be verifiable.  This provenance is important to me as far too man y trees are felled for no good reason without being replaced.

My bowls are all turned on a lathe and finished by hand.  They are not perfect specimen pieces – they are real pieces of wood complete with marks, knots, cracks, twists and warps.  Many are turned ‘green’ (which means fairly fresh after being cut and still quite wet) and as such will continue to dry and find their final shape for some time yet.  This is a natural process and only adds to the unique character of each individual piece.

They are all finished with either wax or oil, see the in individual descriptions for each bowl.  They are ‘food safe’ for use as fruit bowls but I would not recommend using them to eat from.  They would benefit from the occasional waxing (standard furniture wax is fine) or oiling (walnut oil from the supermarket is good), just a light wipe is fine to keep them looking their best.

Don’t  soak in water (wipe with a damp cloth and dry straight away) and avoid direct sunlight for any extended period.  Do pick them up regularly and hold them, feel them and enjoy them!",3000,12334145,2016-01-11 12:02:55 UTC,1973-05-29 23:44:48 UTC

263401045,Dutch Elm Bowl,"Elm wood hand turned & finished bowl.  This is a lovely, characterful, chunky piece of wood with some lovely figuring & spalting in the very wild grain.  Elm is getting quite rare.  This wood came from some self-sown trees we had to have taken down as part of the management of a hedgeline.  It was fairly well seasoned when turned and is unlikely to move much.

It&#39;s finished with wax.

Other wood comes from friends and neighbours who have had trees trimmed or removed.  A few bowls are made from wood bought from a supplier of bowl blanks – this is not a source I use any more, not for any environmental or other concerns, simply because I have a very good stock of more local wood now.  For the future I intend that all of the wood I use will be local and that the source and reason for felling will be verifiable.  This provenance is important to me as far too man y trees are felled for no good reason without being replaced.

My bowls are all turned on a lathe and finished by hand.  They are not perfect specimen pieces – they are real pieces of wood complete with marks, knots, cracks, twists and warps.  Many are turned ‘green’ (which means fairly fresh after being cut and still quite wet) and as such will continue to dry and find their final shape for some time yet.  This is a natural process and only adds to the unique character of each individual piece.

They are all finished with either wax or oil, see the in individual descriptions for each bowl.  They are ‘food safe’ for use as fruit bowls but I would not recommend using them to eat from.  They would benefit from the occasional waxing (standard furniture wax is fine) or oiling (walnut oil from the supermarket is good), just a light wipe is fine to keep them looking their best.

Don’t  soak in water (wipe with a damp cloth and dry straight away) and avoid direct sunlight for any extended period.  Do pick them up regularly and hold them, feel them and enjoy them!",2500,12334145,2016-01-11 12:02:54 UTC,1993-10-11 14:27:09 UTC

263402475,"CANNA THERAPY Cannabis Cream With Full Plant Extract- anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, regenerating and rejuvenating effect","Why hemp cosmetics?

Leave the soft drugs prejudices aside and take a look at cannabis from a different perspective. Despite the notoriety of plant’s reputation, it has proven medicinal and cosmetic qualities. Hemp products are highly valued natural cosmetics. Do you wonder why?

The antiseptic, antibacterial and energizing characteristics of the herb are known to man for centuries. Since ancient times, hemp was widely used against herpes, eczema and various rashes as well as skin problems of any kind.

Hemp seeds are not marijuana seeds

Now is the time to make an important clarification: Hemp seeds are not marijuana seeds, confusing both is common misconception. All types of hemp used in the food, textile and cosmetic industries are specifically cultivated Cannabis crosses generally called industrial hemp. The plant has three major subtypes: Cannabis Sativa, Cannabis Indica and Cannabis Ruderalis. Those designed for everyday use are selected as not to contain (or contain negligible amounts) of the psychoactive substance THC, which is the substance marijuana owes its effect to. It is important to know regarding hemp seed and the seed oil extract, that THC is located in the flowers of the plant not in its seeds.

What makes the hemp oil valuable?

Hemp oil contains more natural essential fatty acids than any other oil extracted from plants in perfect ratio 3:1 - Omega-6: Omega-3. Contains vitamin E which is a natural antioxidant. Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) is very close in composition to the fat cells in the human body. This makes cannabis extract unique for deep hydration of skin cell structures as our body does not manufacture these acids by itself. Hemp also contains a complex of vitamins A, B, C, D and E, essential to skin care. It provides the skin with effective sun protection during summer, and reduces the effects of cold-warm transition or vice versa during winter.

Hemp oil has an exceptional effect:

Moisturizes the skin and brings it to a new life; makes tan uniform; regenerates cells;
Protects against the harmful effects of the environment - wind, sun, UV rays, pollution.
Has an anti-inflammatory effect. Highly suitable for dry and devitalized skin; with problems such as acne, eczema, psoriasis.

Whom is hemp cosmetics suitable for?

Natural hemp cosmetics in the form of creams and ointments protect the skin cells from the adverse external conditions by taking care of the water preservation in the cells, preventing from premature aging. A great advantage is the delicacy of the cannabis extract, making it suitable for sensitive and allergic skin prone to acne.

Daily use of the hemp cosmetics has primarily a preventive cosmetic function, but has also a favorable effect on some common skin diseases such as atopic eczema, psoriasis or acne.

The Canna Therapy cream

The Canna Therapy cream is prepared using advanced technology based on lipophilic-acrylic matrix that reduces irritating emulsifiers. The texture of the Canna Therapy cream is very light, absorbs instantly, does not irritate the skin and leaves no greasy residue. Thanks to its BIO formula, the cream does not contain any petroleum products or animal products, solvents, sulfates, silicones, paragons and artificial colors. Cold pressed hemp oil contains essential fatty acids and gamma-linolenic acid, which takes care of the development of the natural barrier function of the skin.

We have combined the hemp oil carefully with organic unrefined oils from macadamia, almond and rose at a controlled temperature, so as to retain the natural bioactive properties of the oils. Along with the hydrating ingredients such as glycerin, panthenol, valuable natural oils form almond, rose and macadamia the cream is enriched with natural UV filters, protective vitamin E and regenerating and Anti-aging BIO serum. The Canna Therapy cream is suitable for daily care for all skin types, even if very sensitive or problematic skin.


The Canna Therapy cosmetics are unique containing not only hemp oil, but also Cannabis Sativa extract - a source of unsaturated fatty acids, phospholipids and phytosterols, range natural antioxidants, biominerals, vitamins, carotenoids and chlorophylls. Facial cream Canna Therapy has antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antiallergenic and regenerating effect. The product has positive effects on various dermatitis, atopic eczema, psoriasis and acne. By its nourishing natural ingredients the Canna Therapy cream provides a natural protective film for easily irritated and sensitive skin prone to dryness and cracking. The cream contains vitamin B8 inositol vitamin of youth, vitality and health with superb biostimulating and antioxidant effect.


While Carnosine prevents glycation of proteins and keeps skin &quot;forever young&quot; cyclic pentapeptide and ceramides are involved in the renovation, preservation and hydration of the skin cell structures. The skin becomes smooth, elastic, tight and silky. Anti-age complex gradually smooth out wrinkles, makes tan uniform and ameliorates the skin structure, leaving the skin beautiful and with optimal level of hydration.",2500,12334521,2016-01-11 12:18:28 UTC,1999-09-12 20:21:39 UTC

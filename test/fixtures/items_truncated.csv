263400329,Green-turned Eucalyptus Bowl,"Eucalyptus wood hand turned & finished bowl.  This is a beautiful piece of wood turned very fresh.  Eucalyptus is renowned for being very wet and for moving a lot as it dries.  This started out as a perfectly round bowl but has warped and moved to find it&#39;s own shape.  It&#39;s very tactile and has settled into a lovely organic shape.  **It&#39;s fairly dry now but may move more, especially if your home is warmer or drier than mine. This may include cracking and splitting as well as warping and moving.  This is a natural process.  The wood came from a tree surgeon friend who removed an overgrown tree for a customer.

It&#39;s finished with walnut oil.

155mm x 135mm &#39;diameter&#39; x 70mm high

All of the wood I use for my bowls comes from trees grown in the UK from sustainable sources.  The majority of it comes from my own garden – either trimmings or from trees removed as part of regular management.  Other wood comes from friends and neighbours who have had trees trimmed or removed.  A few bowls are made from wood bought from a supplier of bowl blanks – this is not a source I use any more, not for any environmental or other concerns, simply because I have a very good stock of more local wood now.  For the future I intend that all of the wood I use will be local and that the source and reason for felling will be verifiable.  This provenance is important to me as far too man y trees are felled for no good reason without being replaced.

My bowls are all turned on a lathe and finished by hand.  They are not perfect specimen pieces – they are real pieces of wood complete with marks, knots, cracks, twists and warps.  Many are turned ‘green’ (which means fairly fresh after being cut and still quite wet) and as such will continue to dry and find their final shape for some time yet.  This is a natural process and only adds to the unique character of each individual piece.

They are all finished with either wax or oil, see the in individual descriptions for each bowl.  They are ‘food safe’ for use as fruit bowls but I would not recommend using them to eat from.  They would benefit from the occasional waxing (standard furniture wax is fine) or oiling (walnut oil from the supermarket is good), just a light wipe is fine to keep them looking their best.

Don’t  soak in water (wipe with a damp cloth and dry straight away) and avoid direct sunlight for any extended period.  Do pick them up regularly and hold them, feel them and enjoy them!",3000,12334145,2016-01-11 12:02:55 UTC,1973-05-29 23:44:48 UTC
263401045,Dutch Elm Bowl,"Elm wood hand turned & finished bowl.  This is a lovely, characterful, chunky piece of wood with some lovely figuring & spalting in the very wild grain.  Elm is getting quite rare.  This wood came from some self-sown trees we had to have taken down as part of the management of a hedgeline.  It was fairly well seasoned when turned and is unlikely to move much.

It&#39;s finished with wax.

For the future I intend that all of the wood I use will be local and that the source and reason for felling will be verifiable.  This provenance is important to me as far too man y trees are felled for no good reason without being replaced.

My bowls are all turned on a lathe and finished by hand.  They are not perfect specimen pieces – they are real pieces of wood complete with marks, knots, cracks, twists and warps.  Many are turned ‘green’ (which means fairly fresh after being cut and still quite wet) and as such will continue to dry and find their final shape for some time yet.  This is a natural process and only adds to the unique character of each individual piece.

They are all finished with either wax or oil, see the in individual descriptions for each bowl.  They are ‘food safe’ for use as fruit bowls but I would not recommend using them to eat from.  They would benefit from the occasional waxing (standard furniture wax is fine) or oiling (walnut oil from the supermarket is good), just a light wipe is fine to keep them looking their best.

Don’t  soak in water (wipe with a damp cloth and dry straight away) and avoid direct sunlight for any extended period.  Do pick them up regularly and hold them, feel them and enjoy them!",2500,12334145,2016-01-11 12:02:55 UTC,1971-11-27 01:21:37 UTC
263503786,Field Maple Bowl,"Field Maple hand turned & finished bowl.  This is a beautiful piece of wood with some lovely quilting in the bottom and underneath.  It also has some lovely inclusions where the bark has grown inside a crack giving it some gorgeous markings and character.  It&#39;s finished with wax.  This wood came from a neighbour who had the tree trimmed about 5 years ago.

All of the wood I use for my bowls comes from trees grown in the UK from sustainable sources.  The majority of it comes from my own garden – either trimmings or from trees removed as part of regular management.  Other wood comes from friends and neighbours who have had trees trimmed or removed.  A few bowls are made from wood bought from a supplier of bowl blanks – this is not a source I use any more, not for any environmental or other concerns, simply because I have a very good stock of more local wood now.

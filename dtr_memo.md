## Project: Black Thursday
## Group Members: Luigi Aversano, Peter Springer, Robbie Jaeger

### Learning Goals
Luigi: Become more proficient with ERB if this project uses it
Peter: Improve FileIO and Git workflow
Robbie: Improve Single Responsibility Principle for classes

### Collaboration Style
Pair programming and drawing/diagramming everything out so everyone is on the same page seems
to work for everyone.

Work at turing until 6pm or 7pm each weekday. Unless necessary, divide and conquer
to work from home for the night.

### Communication Style
Be direct and honest. Communicate one-on-one while at Turing and DM to the group
on Slack if working at home.

### Tooling
Slack for team communication
Git for version control
Waffle for task management

# Learning Goals

- Understanding Github Workflow in a Group Setting
- Better usage and understanding of class methods
  - Better understanding of inheritance
  - Better understanding of nested collections
- Better understanding of reading from and writing to files
- Reenforcing previous concepts and using them in new ways
- Reenforcing cohort norms within the group

# Individual Strengths/Growths

- Alex McConnell
  - Strength - I’m a very friendly and people-loving individual, which can make me both a
    great leader and a phenomenal person to bounce ideas and issues off of.
  - Areas of Growth - I can sometimes struggle with communicating clearly, and often
    times I can get very lost ‘in the process’ without double checking *why* things work
    the way they do.
- Cole Henson
  - Strength - I am a very strong abstract thinker, and I can find unique and creative
  ways to solve problems.
  - Areas of Growth - I tend to not advocate for myself as much as I should, and I can
  often 'suffer in silence' rather than asking for help and reaching out to others.
- Jacob Yarborough
  - Strength - I'm good at breaking down and understanding complex systems.
  - Areas of Growth - I want to become better at collaboration with others.
- Devin Pile
  - Strength - I work very well with others; I'm able to network very easily, and I
  have many resources we can fall back on, especially in mentor figures.
  - Areas of Growth - I want to be able to be more independent and understand
  functionality of coding on my own legs.

# How do you learn best with coding, and how do you like to collaborate?

- Alex McConnell
  - I learn best by hands on practice
  - I prefer collaboration through direct conversation; either by talking in a
  zoom/slack call with someone while coding or doing driver-navigator
- Cole Henson
  - I learn best through visualization - Reading code and seeing how it all works
  - I also prefer direct contact for conversation; zoom/slack, driver-navigator, etc.
- Jacob Yarborough
  - I learn best through reading and studying, then attempting solutions on my own
  before bringing those solutions to someone else
  - Similar to learning coding, I prefer to work on building solutions on my own before
  discussing with others, ideally over a call.
- Devin Pile
  - My learning is circumstantial, but by teaching I can solidify everything for myself.
  I enjoy working with things hands on, and having a visual aid helps a lot.
  - I prefer collaboration through direct conversation and driver-navigator, similar to
  Alex and Cole.

# Communication

- Alex McConnell
  - Sandwich reflection between the 'goods' ; good thing, talk about what needs
  improvement, finish with another good thing. Written preferred.
  - I prefer communicating over either Slack or directly discussing on a call.
- Cole Henson
  - I prefer having written feedback, so I have something to refer to later. I
  prefer written feedback for giving feedback as well.
  - I prefer Slack for communication, and it's probably best if we aren't on
  a call so that I can at least respond.
- Jacob Yarborough
  - I don't mind how I receive feedback as long as it's constructive; it doesn't
  necessarily need to be purely positive.
  - I prefer giving it over a call; being able to deliver the correct tone is
  ideal and I prefer the more 'casual' format of a call.
  - I prefer Slack for general messages, while calls are better for problem solving
  and working through things. I like taking a moment to gather thoughts before
  hopping on a call to solve problems.
- Devin Pile
  - Similar to Jacob, I don't mind how I receive feedback as long as it's
  constructive, however you feel best communicating that.
  - I prefer giving feedback however individuals prefer; I keep my feedback as
  productive and constructive as possible.
  - I prefer communicating over Slack for general updates, and over a call for
  discussing over a call for problems and working through things. I don't mind
  talking for a quick few minutes to break something down.

## Communication Norms

- Try to work through things on your own! Productive struggle!
  - If you're stuck for more than 15-20 minutes without progression, it's probably
  time to reach out
- Keep Slack to general updates and scheduling of meetings (and memes!)
  - Try to keep topics within threads where possible!
- Keep one-on-one convo within threads/direct DMs. Lean towards threads as long
as it's relevant to the overall project
- Create 'stand-ups' where we can do a quick update on work when initially
getting back together and quickly establishing something. Quick 5-10 minutes.
- Meet up once a day (every other day at most!) to generally check in and make
sure things are going well.

# Group Meet-ups

Stand-up starts at 6:00PM daily (should be like 15 minutes tops)
- Check in as groups, work from there
- Set up meetings individually outside of that via Slack

# Tools for managing the project

- Paired development, find a medium whether driver-navigator or other methods
- Working through separate branches, reviewing and communicating those changes
- Bring individual strengths to the table within those pairs
  - Bring your own unique brainstormed ideas!
- Be willing to vocalize thoughts and issues

# Resolving problems and issues with features

- Escalation Ladder
  - Productively struggle individually
  - Talk with partner if struggling, then full group
- Reach out to circles, get help outside of the group
- Bring cool things from mentor/etc meetups to the group!
- Disagreement in progression
  - Bring in other members of the group
  - If both ways are equally fine, pick one and move on (coinflip if needed)
- Keep cohort norms in mind when discussing issues/problems
Do not be afraid to revisit the DTR
DO NOT BE AFRAID TO REVISIT THE DTR

# How do we know that we are finding success?

- As a group
  - Collaborating well together
  - Continuous feedback cycle
  - Properly utilizing pull requests and branches
  - Achieving learning goals
  - Getting to a point where we all feel the project is passing
  - Communicating effectively
  - Stay friendly with each other, if not friends!
- As individuals
  - Gaining comprehension of concepts
  - Contributing 'our part' (it doesn't have to be exact!)
  - Committing time and effort towards the project
  - Make up with each other if we find struggles during the project

# Final Thoughts

- DO NOT BE AFRAID TO REVISIT THE DTR
- Emphasis on paired programming, break off where needed
- Come back together every day at 6:00PM
- Be flexible with and kind to each other

Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:
What are your learning goals for this project?
1. Learn how to determine when to use classes and modules appropriately.
2. Learn how to traverse a multiple repository set up.
3. Learn to collaborate in programming project.

What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
Over the course of 2 weeks we will use a combination of the two styles. Pair programming will allow us to brainstorm and think together.

How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
Appreciate blunt/straight forward communication with tact. If we are dividing and conquering, we will utilize screen share and other technologies to continue to collaborate.

How would you describe your work style?
Take frequent short breaks over long intervals (pomodoro).

Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
One partner doing a lot of work without the other present and then having to take time to break apart the pre-written code. Figuring when to use classes vs modules was difficult.

What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
We live close together, so a place to work that is not only Turing will be crucial. Google and other online resources. Github, waffle.io, and upper mods/mentors/teachers.

What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
No large restraints - schedule malleable if needed.

What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
In person open and honest feedback. Comments about work can be done through technological communications.

What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
Past work experience working with business analytics, databases, and tables. We can improve on aspects of testing and learning how to traverse tables/a database using Ruby. Good communication skills and connections within in the Turing community.

What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
Waffle.io, Slack, Github

How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
If there is a particular issue one person is struggling with and can't figure it out within a 30 min window, ask the other group member, if we can't figure it out or reach each other, then move on to another aspect until we are able to receive help.

How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
Successfully use TDD to create an object oriented program that scores at least a 3 (meets expectations) in all categories. In addition, learn how to collaborate effectively and improve git workflow.

Any additional questions that you would like to add:
Not at this time.

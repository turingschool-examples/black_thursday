# Project:

Black Thursday

## Group Member Names:

Jamison, Jerrel

## What are your learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?

Jamison: Improve workflow, get more comfortable working with large data sets and a variety of data types. Develop an understanding of fundamental concepts.
Jerrel: Get more comfortable dealing with nested collections and data coming in from different sources

## What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?

Jamison: focus on pair programming, maybe divide-and-conquer in later iterations
Jerrel: focus on paring especially earlier in the project (iterations 1-3)

## How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?

Jamison: Slack, except for thursday evenings and sunday morning/early afternoon
Jerrel: Slack, text messages, one hour ish response

## How would you describe your work style?

Jamison: Input-- taking time to familiarize self project or task beforehand
Jerrel: Take one chunk of work at a time, working on small pieces before implementing them into project

## What are your strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?

Jamison: Input, Individualization, Introspection
Jerrel: Developer, Relator, Empathizer, Adaptability, Learner

working on small fundamental pieces one at a time is something that we both do well.
touching base regularly regarding git workflow
Jerrel will direct regular pomodoro breaks

## Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?

Jamison: Scheduling has gone well, reaching out to multiple sources when understanding isn't clear
Jerrel: Time management is going better, would like to work on keeping a consistent pace and checking in with partner before skipping ahead

## How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?

Jamison: Checking in after each iteration to set goals and make design decisions
Jerrel: Communicating to each other about specific parts of the project.

## How will we overcome obstacles?

Jamison: Taking time to thoroughly understand each problem
Jerrel: Reach out early and often

## What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?

Jamison: Regular breaks, being fed
Jerrel: Quiet space, scheduled breaks

## What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?

Jamison: Not available on Thursday evening or Sunday until 6 PM.
Jerrel: No time constraints. Can start as early as 8am and typically can have fuel until 8pm if pom breaks are consistent.

## What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?

Jamison: Follow the PD guidelines as closely as possible (Applicable, specific, kind). Always prefer to give and receive feedback as long as it is constructive.
Jerrel: Coaching and praise are usually equally easy for me to give in copious amounts when working on a team. I will hold back on giving feed back if I feel it will only add to ego, and not productivity.

## What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?

Jamison: I am becoming more confident in TDD. I need more practice with interacting classes and parsing files.
Jerrel: I feel that my proficiency in edge case testing and also creating tests in general will be a key strength for this project.
Working with enumerators over nested collections is certainly something I need to work on technically. If we get stuck on a problem for more than 30 minutes, I feel we should spend 15-30 minutes researching / reaching out for help.

## What tools do you want to use to manage the project?

Jamison: SimpleCov, Hound CI, Rubocop
Jerrel: HoundCI, Rubocop, SimpleCob, Github / branches and I'd like to look into Waffle for scheduling.

## How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?

Jamison: Slow down and review material if necessary, work on relevant exercises, take a break, and come back to project
Jerrel: Spend 15-30 mins researching problem(s), then reach out if problem persists. Peers > Upper-mods-people > Mentors > Instructors.

## How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?

Jamison: Keeping spec harness in mind, asking clarifying questions before moving forward in order to make sure that we're on the same page
Jerrel: Communicating with one another to ensure clarity / understanding of material(s) covered.

## How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?

Jamison: reviewing our work before working on next iteration, working somewhere other than the Turing basement :)
Jerrel: high 5's, praise, and review to ensure both understand what was solved.

## Project Expectations: What does each group member hope to get out of this project?

Jamison:
Jerrel: Better understanding of testing and working with collections of data, and how best to iterate over them.

## Goals and expectations:

Jamison:
Jerrel: I'm expecting to make significant progress into iteration 5. I do not expect to finish, but it would be great if we did.

## Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):

Jamison:
Jerrel: Daily review to go over worked on material, progress made, and setting up time to meet and expectations for next project period at the end of each project session. 5 minutes tops. We can switch off on watching HoundCI / SimpleCov during/before/after each project session, and keep on top of Rubocop suggestions during project sessions.

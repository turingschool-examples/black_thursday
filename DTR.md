# DTR: Define the Relationship

Use this template to when conducting DTR with your project partners. It's recommended that you copy/paste this template into your own gist each time you conduct a DTR to take notes on the conversation.

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

* What are your learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
  we would both like to focus on clean design, particularly with respect to scalability, in a real-world setting.

* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
  We are both very comfortable with pair programming, especially driver-navigator. we will experiment with some remote pairing but definitely expect to work in person a fair bit on this project.

* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
  We are both primarily concerned with a baseline level of communication, and feel flexible about the style of such. We will definitely communicate thru slack, email, and in person, as needed.

* How would you describe your work style?
  We both like to use the chunked, pomodoro style focused work-sessions. It is important to get good stretches of time without distractions or interruptions. We are going to try to put an effort into planning ahead, which should help us with the collaborative work style.

* What are your strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
  We both share strategic and learner strengths. This will be advantageous as we will need to strategize and learn during this project. I also think that the social nature of one of mine(Dan's) coupled with two of William's strengths will help us relate to one another. William's abilities include a good integrated understanding of both the finer details of a project as well as the higher-level picture and how the two interact. Dan has good attention to detail and is very analytical in approach, which should make for very productive driver-navigator.

* Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
  For me (Dan), in my last paired project we did a very good job of using the techniques we have learned for regaining and maintaining productivity and team cohesion, even when encountering protracted difficulties. I hope to continue that trend through this project.
  William's last pairing had great communication and compatible work styles, allowing for a natural flow of ideas and work. Both went in with very "yes-and..." style states of mind.

* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
  We will make decisions together.

* How will we overcome obstacles?
  We have been instructed on a number of techniques to maintain and recover productivity. We have both had great success with the pomodoro technique in the past and will rely heavily on this for the current project.

* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
  Sleep! We both need space to recover but agree that we need focused collaborative worktime in order to be productive.

* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
  William will have his kids for the first weekend of this project. Dan has almost no time obligations other than school and his dog, so I will be flexible so that we can work when WIlliam is available, and both take breaks when he isn't.

* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
  We are both very upfront and prepared to hear frank feedback from the other, in real-time.

* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
  Dan's strength and confidence lies heavy in testing, and feels less confident in encapsulation implementation. William is strong across the board, and even has some new techniques that might apply to this project that Dan is looking forward to learning about.

* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
  We will be using slack primarily and github and other software will be utilized as necessary, obviously.

* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
  we will be working as a pair for much or most of this project, so talk-it-out and step-back/whiteboard will be our main approaches to problem-solving.

* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
  We will measure success according to our learning goals and the project spec requirements.

* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?
  We will see them take place, as we will likely be together at that time, and we can hoot, holler, and drink beer about them after class.

Pat:

##### How to overcome obstacles:
Harper: Open lines of communication, with regular updates and pull requests so I don't leave my partner wondering what I'm working on
Pat:

##### Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?):
First weekend: Work together. It was suggested to work together through Iteration One, with a divide conquer approach for Iterations 2 and 3.
Second weekend: A regroup to determine how to tackle Iteration 4/5.

##### Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):
Daily communication is critical.  Good comments in pull requests are helpful, and regular commits of working code.

##### Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
Abilities between team members is well matched.  

##### Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
The work should be divided evenly.  As mentioned above, Iterations 0-1 might need to be worked on together, with each team member a solo Iteration, and possibly coming back together for the final iteration.

##### Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):
Regular commits and pull requests, with good notes in pull requests so both team members are working on the newest available version.  Pull requests with no conflicts can be immediately merged without the need to consult the other.

##### Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
Coaching feedback is probably the best type for such a prolonged and exhausting project.  Feedback in-situ and at the end of each Iteration.

##### Agenda to discuss project launch:
 - Scheduling
 - Setting and Meeting Deadlines

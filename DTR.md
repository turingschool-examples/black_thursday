Project name:

Group Member Names: Netia Ingram, Joe Peterson, Zach Trokey, Sidarth Bagawandoss

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):
- Netia: Goal is to pass. If I pass I'll know I was successful.
- Joe: Get better with csv files & try to touch Iteration 5.
- Zach: Goal is to pass. Learn how to use csv files & learn the other stuff we have to install.
- Sid: Goal is to pass & be a valuable contributor to team.

Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here): Direct collaboration is our style for this project.
- Netia: Greatest strength - have no problem asking questions. Collaboration style: like a plan, who's doing what, & what does this look like through iteration 4, how we're going to approach things, PR naming conventions, knowing what this is going to look like the next 1.5 weeks.
- Joe: Strengths- good working in teams. Collaboration style: working with others to help them out. Dividing & conquering gets the work done faster. A combo of pairs & divide & conquer will be the most efficient. Completing the project with everyone understanding the code.
- Zach: Strength - teamplayer, hardwork. Collaboration style: Works well with others or by himself. Love organization & a plan. Helps to know what's expected of me & having a goal to work towards, helps me get there much faster.
- Sid: Strengths - Adapatable & dependable. Collaboration style: practical & team player. I would also having a plan of when things need to be done by & who's responsible for different pieces of the project is essential. Also, being able to ask for help without waiting too long when your struggling is important.
How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:
- We're going to work together to solve the obstacles in our path & ask for help when we get stuck.

### DTR: Define the Relationship - Black Thursday Group Project

Due: June 9, 2021 - 6:00pm MST

Group Member Names: Jacob Piland, Taylor Varoglu, Katherine McConnell, Christina Delpone

Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:
* What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
  * T - learn from mistakes - don't do all the stuff, quality / quantity, practice mocks & stubs; start with a clearer outline; sharing/learning from each other, verbalize ideas
  * X - understand what's actually happening, verbalize ideas - use your words
  * J - solidifying overall concept - visualize project via diagram or talk or something similar
  * K - insight from peers re: group work; more commits!

* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
  * Great - excited! mix of both
* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
  * direct and no fluff, rip the band-aid; written feedback;
  * think in terms of what will make this person better at xyz in the future
* How would you describe your work style?
  * quiet - silent processing, slow processing - then quick to act
  * cognizant of closing the loop on concepts
* What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
  * technical: refactoring, catching small syntactical errors, dream driving
  * soft: project mgmt, devil's advocate, detail oriented
  ##### BE CURIOUS
* Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
  * structured group project work time
  * blocking out more time than needed
  * temp checks -> diminishing return
  * set stage and close curtains
  * celebrate wins - physical acknowledgment
* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
  * completing the DTR aka - set stage before each project work session/day
* How will we overcome obstacles?
  * using outside resources to mine info, but not implementing (this does not equate to not try things out on your own)
  * utilizing slack as a way to keep track of house keeping/code problems/random thoughts/ah ha moments/blockers
  * breaks needed
* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
  * record keeping to refer back to
  * agenda oriented
  * checks and balances
  * working alongside each other and splitting off as needed
* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
  * Xtina - prioritizing learning basics with tutors
  * mondays - 6-7 - no go
  * daily 8-9 am  - no go
  * general block - typical slot 6:30/7 - 9/9:30ish (MT)
  * trying to front load, get the heavy lifting done first, to provide time to refactor:
    * friday 9-10pm - white boarding session
    * saturday 8am - 10
    * sunday - another day at the office (9-12 / 1-4 MT)
    * monday - non-work day
* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
    * Slack, g-cal / g-suite, Github, houndCI (TBD)
* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with * features of the project?
    * Utilize collective networks (mentors, rocks, accountabilibuddies, etc); continue to temp check to ensure mutual understanding
* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
    * Complete requirements through iteration4
    * Work to complete iteration5 (if possible)
    * Prioritize project retro; ensure positive experience, and if not, understand a better course for future projects
    * Dance in the rain, even if it starts to hail a bit
* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?
    * Virtual high fives! (except for Xtina) XD
    * Pesto paws!!!!!!
* Proposed pom cadence:
    * At a minimum, after committing a (potentially) large chunk of work; ~45-60
    * Don't neglect the breaks, "shock to the system" if needed!
    * Feel free to call a timeout whenever it's needed

Project:

Black Thursday

Group Member Names:

Zac Palmquist, Luke Chambers

Project Expectations: What does each group member hope to get out of this project?

Zac : I hope to get better at remote work and team work flow as well as become a better programmer in general

Luke : I want to be able to utilize everything that I have learned up to this point to make the best Black Thursday project.

Goals and expectations:

Zac : I expect that we will finish the project and my goals are to utilize mocks and stubs as well as take advantage of Waffle.io

Luke : I expect to finish the project and meet our personal extensions (Horace Challenge, full testing suite, mocks/stubs). My goals are to finish the project and deliver a fast interface.

Team strengths:

Zac : Abstract thinking, risk taker, likes to communicate so I can spearhead direction for the group if we get lost

Luke : Debugging, writing code. I am good at making sure things work.

How to overcome obstacles:

Zac : Identify the obstacle first, then look at it critically. Take our strengths into account and work around those to overcome whatever comes our way.

Luke : Improvise, adapt, overcome.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?):

Would be ideal to have it02 done by next Monday so we can work on it03 during week and crush the project so we can implement mocks/stubs and hit the Horace Challenge

No earlier then noon on the weekend

Remote work on Saturday starting 2PM

Sunday is on the table considering working in the same space depending on project progress

Be available until 8:30 at Turing during school days.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):

Daily as needed, we have slack.

Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):

Zac : Since I have already done the project I would like to cement the expertise gained from last time into this project.

Luke : I am looking to learn from Zac's last go at this project. He has a wealth of experience that I can draw from to become better myself.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):

Will update as we know more

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):

Good use of branches, no pushing to master, must review PRs, and relevant commits.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:

We both appreciate blunt, honest, open, and kind feedback

Agenda to discuss project launch:

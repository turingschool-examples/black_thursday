Project: Black Thursday

Group Member Names: Kris Litman, Regina Casias, Andrew Smith, Katy La Tour

Project Expectations:

What does each group member hope to get out of this project?
- We look forward to collaborating with one another in a group dynamic and hope to understand a dynamic workflow between multiple group memebers.
- How to work with multiple voices on a project and how you delegate work and pull the project together, while being mindful of everybody's workstyle. 
- Gaining a better understanding of how to work with large datasets and manipulate the data using Ruby. 

Goals and expectations: 
- Our main goal is to effectively communicate with one another so that we can all move forward in our understanding of larger concepts. We expect to come out of this with a greater understanding beyond techinal aspects of working with large datasets, and moreso with working together in a team-setting/environment. We all know the importance of how we will communicate with one another, so we will work together to answer any questions that may arise and play into our individual strengths to help one another overall.

Team strengths: 
- We all do really well at voicing concerns/questions and listening to what each other has to say on a matter. Organization & adhering to a schedule, knowing that we are all in different time zones so we have a plan in place for our flexible schedules. Also recognizing outside commitments.

How to Overcome Obstacles:
- Being able to rely on the resources we have available & keeping an open line of communication so that we are there to help each other. making sure no questions go unanswered and avidly checking the Slack DM channel if somebody posts about a specific question.  
- Advocate for yourself & your needs. If you are not understanding something, don't be afraid to reach out. We are all here for each other!

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?): 
- A little break after class, an hour. Start at 5MST. Play by ear how long we go after start time. Have flexible end time where people can come & go based on the situation(mentor meetings, study for IC, etc). Momentum may dictate how long we continue.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?): 
- Use slack for scheduling, general communication, emergent situations etc. Tuple for project based collaboration
- Instead of Tuple, we've adopted Atom Teletype and Zoom to be able to collaborate more effectively.

Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
- Andrew: asking the right questions, tdd
- Kris: Google, debugging, chunking problems, using enumerables
- Katy: debugging with pry, chunking problems
- Regina: chunking problems, strong work ethic and energy to work for long periods of time

- Areas for Improvement:
 - Group: Productive struggle, and knowing when we are not productively struggling anymore and just exhausting our mental abilities to keep working
 - Katy: Not waste time overanalyzing problems and just try something to see if it works, then go from there with given information
 - Regina: Build self-confidence with technical abilities in Ruby and working with OOP concepts
 - Andrew: Don't get hung up on an approach, put the pen to the paper and try something. Incorporate more collaboration effort on difficult logic.
 - Kris: Verbalizing concepts and being a better teacher/verbalizing thoughts

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
- TBD as we start to work through iteration and expectations; As we start working on iterations, we can determine how to divide up the work too amongst each other.
- Dividing and conquering in pairs is an approach we've taken, for harder concepts, work together as a team

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):
- We would like to utilize Tuple app to better our collaboration with team members. If we work together, we would like to be cognizant of refactors for pull request messages. We would like to make sure that we always ask questions that come up, to stay on track and avoid future bugs.
- How we are managing version control between four of us has so far been fine with no merge conflicts yet. Still getting the hang of how we push/pull in pairs and who all needs to comment on pull requests or is it a group effort?

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback: 
- We would like to stay open to suggestions for different approaches and stay direct but positive with intention. Meaningful feedback will help further our understanding of the project and further our learning.

Agenda to discuss project launch:  

Ideas: We will first finish our DTR. We will then focus on a plan for iteration 0 and map out how to tackle features.
- Road map how we will move forward with each iteration by reviewing as a team and deciding how to split up work if need be

Tools: We will start by using zoom and transition to tuple for hands on project work.
       - Zoom and Atom teletype and Slack

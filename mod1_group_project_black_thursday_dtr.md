Project: Black Thursday

Group Member Names: Kris Litman, Regina Casias, Andrew Smith, Katy La Tour

Project Expectations:

What does each group member hope to get out of this project?
- We look forward to collaborating with one another in a group dynamic and hope to understand a dynamic workflow between multiple group memebers. 

Goals and expectations: Our main goal is to effectively communicate with one another so that we can all move forward in our understanding of larger concepts. We expect to come out of this with a greater understanding beyond techinal aspects of working with large datasets, and moreso with working together in a team-setting/environment. We all know the importance of how we will communicate with one another, so we will work together to answer any questions that may arise and play into our individual strengths to help one another overall.

Team strengths: We all do really well at voicing concerns/questions & also listening. Organization & adhering to a schedule, knowing that we are all in different time zones so we have a plan in place for our flexible schedules. Also recognizing outside commitments.

How to overcome obstacles:Being able to rely on the resources we have available & keeping an open line of communication so that we are there to help eachother. Advocate for yourself & your needs. If you are not understanding something,
reach out!

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?): A little break after class, an hour. Start at 5MST. Play by ear how long we go after start time. Have flexible end time where people can come & go based on the situation(mentor meetings, study for IC, etc). Momentum may dictate how long we continue.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):Communication expectations: use slack for scheduling, general communication, emergent situations etc. Tuple for project based collaboration

Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
Andrew: asking the right questions, tdd
Kris: Google, debugging, chunking problems, using enumerables
Katy: debugging, chunking problems
Regina: chunking problems, strong work ethic and energy to work for long periods of time

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):TBD as we start to work through iteration and expectations; As we start working on iterations, we can determine how to divide up the work too amongst each other.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):We would like to utilize tuple to better collaboration with team members. If we work together, we would like to be cognizant of refactors for pull request messages. We would like to make sure that we always ask questions that come up, to stay on track and avoid future bugs.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback: We would like to stay open to suggestions for different approaches and stay direct but positive with intention. Meaningful feedback will help further our understanding of the project and further our learning.

Agenda to discuss project launch:  

Ideas: We will first finish our DTR. We will then focus on a plan for iteration 0 and map out how to tackle features.

Tools: We will start by using zoom and transition to tuple for hands on project work.

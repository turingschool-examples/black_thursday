Black Thursday
===============

A business is only as smart as its data. In this project, Jake and I build a system able to load, parse, search, and execute business intelligence queries against the data from a typical e-commerce business. Through the principles of TDD, SRP and by communicating with each other in an effective manner, we were able to complete this project with 100%
test coverage while meeting all the requirements of the [spec harness](https://github.com/turingschool/black_thursday_spec_harness).

Project Overview
-----------------

### Our Goals

*   Complete all the iterations assigned to us in a timely manner
*   Use TDD for the project and achieve 100% test coverage
*   Use test fixtures instead of actual data when testing, to speed up our tests
*   Keep a track of our project and issues using [Waffle.io](http://waffle.io)
*   Connect related objects together through references
*   Use modules in an effective manner to streamline methods that are common across classes
*   Have strong git workflow, committing frequently to document our progress and utilizing pull requests for communication and feedback
*   Learn an agile approach to building software

### Getting Started and Initial Setup

1.  Nikhil forked the repository [here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/black_thursday) and added Jake as a collaborator
2.  Jake and Nikhil then cloned this repository
3.  We created a [Waffle.io](http://waffle.io) account for project management. We entered and assigned tasks as we thought of them in the 'To Do' column
    These tasks were then moved to the 'In Progress' column, as the person assigned to them started to work on them. Finally, upon completing a task, the task was moved to the 'Done' column. Since waffle is linked to our GitHub, any changes made to waffle were automatically reflected in our GitHub repo
4.  We setup [SimpleCov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov) to monitor test coverage along the way as it was our intent to achieve 100% test coverage

### Project Iterations

Due to the lengthy and complex nature of the project, it was broken down into the following iterations. We were asked to implement iterations 0 through 3 and do either 4 or 5.
We chose to complete iteration 4 as it was considered more complex of the two.

*   [Iteration 0](https://github.com/Shniks/black_thursday/blob/iteration_0_nikhil/black_thursday_iterations/iteration_0.md) - Merchants & Items
*   [Iteration 1](https://github.com/Shniks/black_thursday/blob/iteration_0_nikhil/black_thursday_iterations/iteration_1.md) - Beginning Relationships and Business Intelligence
*   [Iteration 2](https://github.com/Shniks/black_thursday/blob/iteration_0_nikhil/black_thursday_iterations/iteration_2.md) - Basic Invoices
*   [Iteration 3](https://github.com/Shniks/black_thursday/blob/iteration_0_nikhil/black_thursday_iterations/iteration_3.md) - Item Sales
*   [Iteration 4](https://github.com/Shniks/black_thursday/blob/iteration_0_nikhil/black_thursday_iterations/iteration_4.md) - Merchant Analytics
*   [Iteration 5](https://github.com/Shniks/black_thursday/blob/iteration_0_nikhil/black_thursday_iterations/iteration_5.md) - Customer Analytics

### Spec Harness

This project is being assessed with the help of a [spec harness](https://github.com/turingschool/black_thursday_spec_harness). The `README.md` file includes instructions for setup and usage. This spec harness **does not** replace our own test suite (where we intend to have full 100% coverage using TDD).

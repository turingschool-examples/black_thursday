## Black Thursday

A business is only as smart as its data. Let's build a system able to load, parse, search, and execute business intelligence queries against the data from a typical e-commerece business.

Project Overview
Learning Goals
Use tests to drive both the design and implementation of code
Decompose a large application into components
Use test fixtures instead of actual data when testing
Connect related objects together through references
Learn an agile approach to building software
Getting Started
One team member forks the repository at https://github.com/turingschool-examples/black_thursday and adds the other(s) as collaborators.
Everyone on the team clones the repository
Create a Waffle.io account for project management.
Setup SimpleCov to monitor test coverage along the way
Spec Harness
This project will be assessed with the help of a spec harness. The README.md file includes instructions for setup and usage. Note that the spec harness is not a replacement for your own test suite.

Key Concepts
From a technical perspective, this project will emphasize:

File I/O
Relationships between objects
Encapsulating Responsibilities
Light data / analytics
Project Iterations and Base Expectations
Because the requirements for this project are lengthy and complex, we've broken them into Iterations in their own files. Your project must implement iterations 0 through 3.

Iteration 0 - Merchants & Items
Iteration 1 - Beginning Relationships and Business Intelligence
Iteration 2 - Basic Invoices
Iteration 3 - Item Sales
Iteration 4 - Merchant Analytics
Iteration 5 - Customer Analytics
Evaluation Rubric
The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

1.  Functional Expectations
    4: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, (4 or 5), and features of your own design
    3: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5
    2: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, and 3
    1: Application does not fully implement iterations 0, 1, 2, and 3
2.  Test-Driven Development
    4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data
    3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
    2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
    1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD
3.  Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
    4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
    3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
    2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear
    1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together
4.  Fundamental Ruby & Style
    4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
    3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
    2: Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring
    1: Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution
5.  Enumerable & Collections
    4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods
    3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
    2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques
    1: Application demonstrates deficiencies with Enumerable and struggles with collections
6.  Code Sanitation
    The output from rake sanitation:all shows...

4: Zero complaints
3: Five or fewer complaints
2: Six to ten complaints
1: More than ten complaints

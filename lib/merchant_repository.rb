# This object holds all of the merchants. On initialization, we feed in the
# seperated out list of merchants, which we obtained from the CSV file. For each
# row, denoted here by the merchant variable, we insantiate a new item object
# that includes a reference to it's parent. We store this list in the
# merchant_list isntance variable, allowing us to reference the list outside of
# this class. The list is stored as an array.
